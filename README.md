# Hangman
A simple Hangman game within the console. 
How To Play
In a normal game of Hangman, one player thinks of a word (known as the Executioner) and draws the gallows. The other player will guess a letter. Then, the Executioner, depending on if the letter is in the word, will either write that letter in the correct place, or draw another body part on the gallows. This will repeat until a full body has been drawn on the gallows, or the word has been completed. In this Hangman game, the computer is the Executioner.
